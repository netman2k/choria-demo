    # A wrapper class around the EM based NATS gem
    #
    # MCollective has some non EM compatible expectations about how
    # message flow works such as having a blocking receive and publish
    # method it calls when it likes, while typical EM flow is to pass
    # a block and then callbacks will be called.
    #
    # This wrapper bridges the 2 worlds using ruby Queues to simulate the
    # blocking receive expectation MCollective has thanks to its initial
    # design around the Stomp gem.
    #
    # The EM code is run in a Thread and all EM stuff is done there, this will
    # hopefully sufficiently isolate the competing threading models.
